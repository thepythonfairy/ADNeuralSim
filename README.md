# ADNeuralSim
ðŸ§ Welcome to the ADNeuralSim Repository!

## **Hey team!**

This is our repository for our Alzheimer"s Neural Signal Simulation Project. Each of you will be assigned a module that contributes to our shared simulation. Your task is to write a clean, documented Python function inside of your assigned .py file in the /modules folder via Jupyter Notebooks.

Please follow the instructions in the README and your Research Hour-Log.

## **Each module should be:**

-Resusable and testable  
-Saved in correct folder and file  
-Documented with comments  

One you have completed your assigned task(s), update your status on the Research Hour-Log and let me know what you have completed via email or message.

If you have any questions, let me know!
